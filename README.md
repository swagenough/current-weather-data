A small project made by me that's learning how to integrate API on Node.js
It will greet you based on your inputted name, and give you the current weather data based on what city/country you've inputted.
After importing the repo, on the terminal, you should switch to the file directory and then use ```npm link``` to symlink for the code to be executed!
After that, execute the `weatherAPI` command. Also don't forget to get your api key. That's all
